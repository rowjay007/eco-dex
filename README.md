# Eco-Dex: E-commerce Microservices Platform

## Overview

Eco-Dex is a modern, scalable e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The platform provides a robust foundation for building and deploying e-commerce applications with features like user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, payment integration, and real-time notifications.

## System Design

### High-Level Architecture
- Microservices-based architecture for modularity and scalability
- Event-driven communication using Apache Kafka
- Distributed caching with Redis
- Load balancing and API Gateway using Nginx
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of services based on load
- Database sharding and replication
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Message queue for asynchronous processing
- CDN integration for static assets

### Security Measures
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Architecture

The platform consists of the following microservices:

- **User Service** (Port 3001): Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management
- **Product Service** (Port 3002): Manages product catalog, inventory, and search functionality
- **Cart Service** (Port 3003): Manages shopping cart operations with Redis-based caching
- **Order Service** (Port 3004): Processes orders and manages order lifecycle
- **Payment Service** (Port 3005): Handles payment processing and transaction management
- **Notification Service** (Port 3006): Manages real-time notifications and alerts

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Nginx
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Advanced Features

### Search and Filtering
- Elasticsearch integration for product search
- Advanced filtering and faceted search
- Search suggestions and autocomplete

### Performance Optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Database query optimization
- Response caching
- Minification and bundling of assets

### Analytics and Reporting
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Sales and inventory reports
- User behavior tracking
- Performance metrics monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Make (for using Makefile commands)

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rowjay007/eco-dex.git
   cd eco-dex
   ```

2. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   make dev-setup
   ```

3. Install dependencies for all services:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

4. Start the services using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

5. Access the services:
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
   - Individual service endpoints are available at their respective ports

### Environment Variables

The platform uses a centralized `.env` file for base configuration, with service-specific `.env` files for individual service configuration. Key environment variables include:

- `NODE_ENV`: Application environment
- `DB_*`: Database configuration
- `REDIS_*`: Redis configuration
- `KAFKA_*`: Kafka configuration
- Service-specific ports and configurations
